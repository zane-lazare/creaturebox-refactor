## Current Errors

| Timestamp | Directory/File | Error Type | Description | Resolution Status | Resolution Notes |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2025-03-08T14:35:00Z | Repository Setup | Minor | Documentation branch already exists but doesn't follow required structure | RESOLVED | Structure being aligned to requirements |

- **Major**: Significantly impacts documentation quality
- **Minor**: Small issues that can be easily fixed
- **Warning**: Potential issues to be aware of

## Error Prevention Strategies
